Tags are a very useful way of grouping multiple notes so they are easy to find. A tag is essentially a clickable search through your entire Vault for a term. For example, clicking on #tags will bring up a search with all notes that contain that tag. Most people use them for broad categories of things, like a class you might be taking notes in or a type of idea. Some Zettelkasten practitioners like to use them as "entry points" for thinking about connected ideas. But ultimately, they are flexible enough that you can use them in any way you would like.  

If you have the [[Tag pane]] plugin enabled, you will see a list of all tags that are used across all of your notes, sorted by frequency. Clicking on any of those will activate that search.  

If you want to use subtags, you can use these formats:

- CamelCase: #MaintagSubtag
- Underscore: #maintag_subtag
- Dash: #maintag-subtag

This will allow you to click to search, as per usual, but if you want to find all instances of `maintag` with all subtags, you can still use the [[Search]] to look for `#maintag`. This is useful in cases where you have subcategories of things but you also want to be able to easily find all instances of the higher category.
